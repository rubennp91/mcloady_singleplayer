# mcloady_singleplayer
mcloady_singleplayer is a variation of [mcloady](https://github.com/rubennp91/mcloady). Refer to mcloady for more information about this program.

## Usage
Download the python file (you will need to have python 3 installed on your machine) or the compiled exe file. Fill the sections [FILE] and [PARAMETERS] in the config.ini file.

Once that is done, you can run the program it will wait for you to press enter and after ten seconds it will take control. In those five seconds you have to focus your Minecraft Window and you have to be able to move your player with your mouse.

To stop the program at any time, change the window in between teleports to the command line and press 'Ctrl + C'.
